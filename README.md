## Synopsis

This role acts as a runner for a single [`install_mfsbsd_iso.sh` script](https://github.com/click0/FreeBSD-install-scripts/blob/master/install_mfsbsd_iso.sh).  
(That's why there is `lite` in the role name too)  
This script to fetch [MfsBSD](https://mfsbsd.vx.sk) ISO to boot partition of Linux.  
It also modifies the grub settings so that the machine can start MfsBSD on its own after a reboot.  
The script itself determines the network settings of the machine and transfers them during the subsequent reboot.
